# Netflix Data Analysis 


Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis project! Netflix, which started in 1997 as a DVD rental service, has now evolved into one of the largest entertainment and media companies globally. With its vast library of movies and series, it provides an excellent opportunity to delve into the entertainment industry using exploratory data analysis techniques.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to investigate whether the average duration of movies on Netflix has been declining over time. Utilizing the provided dataset, we will analyze movie durations and explore potential contributing factors to any observed trends.

## Dataset
